# User Guide
A number will be displayed inside square brackets (e.g '[num]' and the game will ask you whether if the next number is going to be higher, lower or the same. Another number will be printed right below your answer and the game will tell you whether you're correct or not.

Every player starts of with 0 points. For each correct answer, a point will be rewarded to the player. If you enter 'higher' or 'lower' and are correct, you gain 1 point. If you enter 'higher' or 'lower' and the next number turns out to be the same, it will be counted as correct but no point will be given. However, if you guess that the next number will be the same, you will be awarded 10 points instead!

After each round, your score will be displayed and another round will start printing a new number.
The game will continue for as long as the player gets each answer correct. The game ends when a user gets an answer wrong! Have fun and guess wisely!
